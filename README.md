Project for Unit9

Launching the project:
  Load the main scene "MainGame". As it opens, the game starts.
Controls:
  Press "Space" to go up. If you release it, the character goes down, and if he touches the bottom of the screen he dies.
  Press "R" to restart the game.
  
Summary:
  2 blocks composed of 6 slots each scroll down as the character goes up. Each slot contain a level design feature (e.i. opening/closing gate, enemy on platform shooting toward the character). As soon as one of the block isn't displayed on the screen anymore, it goes back up reseting its slots in order to have a brand new level design coming up.
  The game doesn't have an end unless the player dies. The longer the player stay alive, the more he will get points.
  
  
What's missing:
  The scoring system hasn't been programmed yet.
  The blocks don't renew their slots when they are not screen anymore.
  More level design features.
  Better movement of the player.
  Menu.
  
Problems:
  The level design features don't go properly  where the slots are, therefore they are spread across the scene making the game unfortunately almost unplayable.
  Various bugs easily fixable.
  Improvement of the behavior of some level design features.
